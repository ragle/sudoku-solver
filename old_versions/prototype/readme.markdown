The code in sudoku.js is not for the faint of heart. This is my prototype that I blasted out in an afternoon the day before the original assignment was due in my Discrete Math class. It totally works, but it also totally makes my eyeballs bleed.

Indention hell, lots of redundant code and the typical smell that comes with working too quickly, without a plan or a full understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. :)

For a refactored, actually readable, maintainable version - check out the /public/app directory. 

Cheers!
